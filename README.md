# FindKeja Web Application

FindKeja is a web application that allows users to log in or sign up using their email/password or Google account. 
Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the main user page. Clicking on the estate search field displays all available 
house listings verified by admins, categorized by estate name. Users can select a listing to view more details about the house. 
Additionally, users can search for a specific estate name to find details and proceed to book the house or 
contact the verified management (e.g., agency or owner).

The frontend is developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It is deployed on Vercel: (https://findkeja.vercel.app/)

The server-side is built on Node.js and uses a JSON server (JSON database). It is deployed on Render: (https://findkeja-server.onrender.com/)
Backend repo: https://github.com/Rommie254/findkeja-server
